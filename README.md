Checkpoint
==========

Protocol to prevent useless checkpoints
Compile and Run:
=============
1) Locate script.sh, Config.txt make changes to them as necessary in terms of paths of files and directories for compiling and output, and ip addresses and port numbers of machines to run the app.
2) Run the script.sh, on a bash shell, it is completely automated to compile the source files and run the application on machines as specified in Config.txt.
2) There will be files generated for the different machines, which will have an extension of .out in out folder.
3) Check for the number of forced checkpoints in each of the .out file and sum it up to find the total number of forced check points for the system.
